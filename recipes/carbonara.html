        <h3><em>When a man at church found out how much my family likes fettuccine, he shared his Italian grandmother's carbonara recipe with us. I've made it my own over the last 25 years. Grated Parmesan cheese works just as well as Romano. —Kristine Chayes, Smithtown, New York</em></h3>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
    <li>1/2 pound bacon strips, chopped</li>
    <li>1 package (16 ounces) fettuccine</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup half-and-half cream</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
    <li>Additional grated Romano cheese, optional</li>


    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>

    <li>In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crisp, stirring occasionally. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Discard drippings, reserving 1 tablespoon in skillet.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, cook fettuccine according to package directions. Drain; return to pan.</li>
    <li>Add onion to drippings in skillet; cook and stir over medium heat 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Stir in cream. In a small bowl, whisk a small amount of warm cream into eggs; return all to skillet, whisking constantly. Cook 8-10 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160°, stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Stir cheese, salt, pepper and bacon into sauce. Add to fettuccine and toss to combine. Sprinkle with parsley and, if desired, additional cheese. Serve immediately.</li>
